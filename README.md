# SQL_Database_Project
Migrating database and including Excel connectivity

ODBC file was used to connect the Microsoft Access database to Microsoft SQL Server. 

Opening the access file you should see that each table has been recognized as a database object (DBO) and that is the table which is linked to SQL server. This allows to the database to be stored on the cloud but still allows for control and manipulation through Microsoft Access

Since this was for a school project and I don't believe the university hosted SQL Server is running anymore, I've posted the macro code that allows excel to interact with the databse as well as a video which shows how the macros ran.
