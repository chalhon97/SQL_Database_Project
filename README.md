# SQL_Database_Project
Migrating database and including Excel connectivity

ODBC file was used to connect the Microsoft Access database to Microsoft SQL Server. 

Opening the access file you should see that each table has been recognized as a database object (DBO) and that is the table which is linked to SQL server. This allows to the database to be stored on the cloud but still allows for control and manipulation through Microsoft Access

The macros require Microsoft ActiveX data objects 6.1 to run (currently unavailable for mac). Please make sure this is enabled when you attempt to run the macros otherwise you will get a compile error. 

To enable this open the macro window and go to tools -> referneces and check off the ActiveX data objects 6.1 box if not     alrady checked. 
  
Even if you are unable to run the macros feel free to look at the macro Code file seperately 

In addition, I have also included a video of how the macros are supposed to run.
